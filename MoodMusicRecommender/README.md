#Project name is mood music recommender

This is a mini project which is purely based on java program this project includes features of Java. I made a simple console based program which helps user to find songs according to their mood. It is not very high level program,but it is based on simple java concepts that are taught during the lessons

I chose this idea because sometimes we find hard to find songs that are based on our mood, so I thought why not to make something which actually helps the user to find songs similar to their mood

The project shows different mood options like sad, happy, etc.
Gives a set of songs which are based on the user mood that they selected
If user wants to add there favourite or want to save there song they can do it, and it will save under favourites.txt file
User can see there saved songs

##Concepts are mainly used from syllabus:
Java collections which includes hashmap, array list
File handling that means reading or writing to a test file
Conditional statements
Simple functions for modularisation

##How I planned it
Firstly, I wrote down what the program should do then I divided it into small parts
Show menu
Take the input from user about their mood
According to their mood display songs
Ask the user id they want to add their own songs
Save songs
Detect the mood of user by the text also

##Tools that I used:
Java JDK
IntellIJ IDEA but any IDE will work

##Project structure:
/src
Mood music recommender.java
Favourites.txt
README.md

##How to run it:
Open the project in intellIJ or any java IDE will work
Now go to the src folder
Run the MoodmusicRecommender.java file
Follow the instructions that are present on the screen after running the file

##Testing:
I already tested the program by trying different mood inputs, checking wrong inputs and verifying the favourite file to check whether the songs are added or not, I checked if it is updating or not

##Conclusion:
This is a simple project it helps me to revise all the java basics that are taught during the lessons and I now understand how to organize a small appliance using the concepts that are taught in class.
